# driving_violation_record
In this project, I use 91740 driving violation records for 6 districts in Rhode Island, USA. <p>
The data was collected by <a href="https://assets.datacamp.com/production/repositories/1497/datasets/62bd9feef451860db02d26553613a299721882e8/police.csv">DataCamp</a> and consist of driving violation records from 2005-2015. <p>
I found that there are rising records at particular hours and analyzed the reason. Also, I found that the police work is efficient whenever there are stop protocols for the driver.
